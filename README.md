# Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis and Recommendations for Reduction


In this project we are going to critique a preliminary analysis of readmissions data and recommendations for reducing the readmissions rate and then make recommendations based on a statiscal analysis.

Background:

In October 2012, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.
